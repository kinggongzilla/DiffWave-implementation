# DiffWave-implementation
A custom DiffWave implementation I am doing in the course of the Practical Work in AI course at JKU. 

# How to execute

1. Load conda env with "conda env create --name envname --file=environments.yml"
2. Activate conda environment with "conda activate envname"
3. If on Mac/Linux install sox with "conda install -c conda-forge sox"
4. Run "python main.py [path to data_folder]"


data_folder should be one folder containing .mp3 files.
